# Designing Agent Architecture
***NOTE:*** *Use it as a references, it's just notes, there are lots of compile errors!*

## Description
This directory containts the **Agentic AI Architecture Stack** for the future leveraging. These design patterns are associated with the "**Building Agentic AI with Rust**" book written by **John Lakewood**, so it's basically notes from the book.
