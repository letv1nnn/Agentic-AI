# Agentic AI Architecture

This repository contains some approaches and design patterns for building AI Systems. It serves as a notes that can be used in a real agents, patterns explores a lot of interesting topics such as Reactive programming, llm integration, deployment stages and integration of many technologies. 

## Discussed topics
- [***Connecting LLM API***](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Agentic-AI-Architecture/tree/main/connecting_llm_api) - templates for openai and ollama api connection.

- [***Core Agent Architecture***](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Agentic-AI-Architecture/tree/main/core_agent_architecture) - basic implementation of a reactive programming approach and a simple actor model using shared state, instead of isolated ownership.
    
    I've created created 4 modeules: ***"agent traits and behavior model"***, ***"task execution, tool invocation and error handling"***, ***"event-driven design patterns"*** and ***"message passing and state management"***. Each moduleâ€™s implementation is described with its corresponding name. I strongly recommend to read my [***Fearless Concurrency***](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Computer-Science/tree/main/Fearless-Concurrency) research written in Rust, it describes many useful topics related to the agent architecture such as ***Reactive Programming***, ***Coroutines*** and ***Actor Model***.

- [***Tool-Using Agents***](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Agentic-AI-Architecture/tree/main/tool_using_agents) - some code that describes secure tool execution.

    It consists of three modules: ***"chaining tool-use"***, ***"safe system-level commands execution"*** and ***"secure tool functions"***. Basically, these modules contain the right design pattern to execute tools and make a pipeline execution.

- [***Aotonomous Workflow Execution and Planning***](https://github.com/letv1nnn/Agentic-AI-Architecture/tree/main/autonomous_workflow_execution_and_planning) - this module focuses on building a planner that translates goals into sequenced, tool-based actions.

    I've built a local planner that can take a high-level goal and generate a sequence of subgoals or tool steps, each of which can be executed and monitored. I've also implemented memory modules to persist context between steps, allowing the agent to recall prior state, manage dependencies, and resume failed plans. Then, I've explored techniques for decomposing goals into subtasks that can be executed concurrently or in sequence.
